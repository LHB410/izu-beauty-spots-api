In 1969, management of the villa and its grounds was taken over by Numazu City and they were reopened as the publicly accessible Numazu Imperial Villa Memorial Park. The main building was destroyed by fire during World War II but the West and East Annexes remain. The West Annex is a valuable example of Imperial Court architecture and offers a glimpse of early 20th-century Imperial life. With advance reservation, you can visit the East Annex or even rent it out for purposes such as practicing traditional Japanese culture or taking commemorative wedding photographs. Meanwhile, the villa’s Japanese garden is great for a leisurely stroll. Boasting a variety of flowers that blossom throughout the year, it provides a different vista each season. The garden also houses a café and a soba restaurant, and even offers a view of the sun setting over Suruga Bay.",

It is also steeped in history, having been the site of a battle between the Takeda Clan and the Later Hojo Clan in the late 1500s. Senbon Matsubara was razed in the fighting, but was later painstakingly rehabilitated over five years by Zoyo Shonin, a famed Buddhist monk.
